## Overview

BlanketStatsments is an R package to build, analyse, and compare statistical models.
The core idea is to produce nested models differing in one characteristic (predictors, outcomes) respectively.
For examples of use see https://github.com/p-mq/Percentile_based_averaging

## Installation

BlanketStatsments is no longer under active development, but issues will be maintained if necessary. You can install it directly from github, but I am considering a release to CRAN.

``` r
# Get the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p-mq/BlanketStatsments")
```
